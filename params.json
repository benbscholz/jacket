{"name":"Jacket","body":"## what is jacket?\r\n\r\nJacket is a compiler and interactive interpreter for a subset of Scheme. Written in Javascript, it allows the execution of jacket source files through a web \r\nbrowser or from the command line.\r\n\r\n## jacket in the browser\r\n\r\nTo use jacket in a web browser, include a jacket source file using a script tag\r\nwith the language property set to `language/jacket`:\r\n\r\n\t<script src=\"lib/stdlib.jkt\" type=\"language/jacket\"></script>\r\n\r\nInclude the jacket compiler:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t<script src=\"jacket.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nYour jacket script will automatically compile and execute when the page loads.\r\n\r\n## jacket interpreter\r\n\r\nThe jacket interpreter is built on top of `Spidermonkey 1.8.5`. Install\r\nSpidermonkey with homebrew `brew install spidermonkey`, or your favorite package\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nRun the interpreter from the `src/` directory:\r\n\r\n\t./repl.js\r\n\r\nTo exit the interpreter, evaluate `(quit)`.\r\n\r\nThe Javascript evaluated in the interpreter is same as the output of the\r\ncompilation in the browser. Any differences in behavior are likely a result of\r\ndiscrepencies between the Spidermonkey backend and other Javascript\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\n## jacket standard library\r\n\r\nA jacket script can call any Javascript function. There are a number of built-in\r\nfunctions which can be found in `src/built_ins.js`. \r\n\r\n## jacket compilation\r\n\r\nJacket compilation is a 3 step process.\r\n\t\r\n\t1) Preprocessing: Removal of illegal characters & symbol/string distinction.\r\n\t2) Parsing:       Transform the jacket script into a syntax tree.\r\n\t3) Translation:   Generate appropriate Javascript code from the syntax tree.\r\n\r\nJacket also includes a balanced parentheses checker `_wellness`. It uses\r\n[beautify.js](https://github.com/einars/js-beautify) as a pretty-printer,\r\n`_pretty`.\r\n\r\n## jacket translation examples\r\n\r\nfib.jkt:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(define (fib n)\r\n\t(if (< n 2)\r\n\t\tn\r\n\t\t(+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nfib.js:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fib = function(n) {\r\n\tif (lt_proc(n, 2)) {\r\n\t\treturn n;\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\treturn add_proc(fib(sub_proc(n, 1)), fib(sub_proc(n, 2)));\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n## jacket: to do\r\n\r\nJacket currently provides minimal functionality; there are still plenty of\r\nissues to iron out. \r\n\r\n`translator.js` - Fix code generation bugs. \r\n\r\n`wellness.js`   - Add useful error messages.\r\n\r\n`repl.js`       - Implement history for interactive interpreter.\r\n\r\n`tests.js`      - Write test for code generation.\r\n\r\n## license\r\njacket is MIT licensed.\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (C) 2012 Ben Brooks Scholz \r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n\tof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to \r\n\tdeal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the \r\n\trights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or \r\n\tsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is \r\n\tfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in \r\n\tall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n\tIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \r\n\tFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
